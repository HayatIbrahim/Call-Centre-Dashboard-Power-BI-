# Call-Centre-Dashboard-Power-BI-
I recently developed an advanced Call Center Dashboard using Power BI to streamline performance tracking and deliver actionable insights for operational improvement of Call Centre.
Key Metrics (KPIs): The dashboard includes essential KPIs such as total calls received, total calls attended, unattended calls, total call duration, issues resolved, response rate, and the average speed of answering calls. These KPIs provide a quick snapshot of overall performance.
Total Calls by Day (Line Chart): This chart illustrates the volume of calls received throughout the week, with Monday being the busiest day. This allows call Centre Manager to better allocate resources during peak times and enhance customer service availability.
Call and Issue Resolution (Pie Charts): Two pie charts provide a breakdown of call attendance and issue resolution. Manager proud to report that 81.08% of calls are successfully attended, and 72.92% of issues are resolvedâ€”a strong indication that call Centre team is efficiently managing most customer inquiries and issues.
Call Trends by Week Type (Donut Charts): These visuals compare call volumes and response rates between weekdays and weekends. 70.32% of calls are received on weekdays, with the remaining 29.68% on weekends. Interestingly, the response rate remains nearly balanced: 50.04% on weekdays and 49.96% on weekends. Despite fewer days, the weekend performance holds up remarkably well, showing consistency in response strategy.
Customer Satisfaction (Gauge Chart): This chart tracks our customer satisfaction levels. While Call Centre target satisfaction score is 4.5, the current average is 3.5. This insight drives focus on improving customer interactions and striving to meet the satisfaction target.
Agent Performance (Column Chart): A comparative analysis of call volume handled by each agent reveals that Jim handles the most calls, while Stewart handles the least. This data helps identify top performers and areas where additional training or support may be needed.
Call Reasons (Treemap): The treemap visually highlights the reasons for customer calls, with streaming issues being the most frequent cause, and contract-related inquiries being the least. This insight helps prioritize the types of issues that require more attention and resources.
This dashboard allows for a data-driven approach to managing call center operations, improving response times, and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.
